    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In many research studies that rely on human participants, recruiting and managing large groups of people can be a resource-intensive process. This is especially true in data-centric studies where the goal is to collect behavioural data, such as gameplay activity on a video game server. In this case, a research team at UBC is collecting data from players on a Minecraft server to study player behaviour patterns. However, not all players contribute equal amounts of data. Some players play extensively, generating detailed data logs, while others participate only briefly, providing relatively small amounts of data in comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building models that can help predict which types of players are likely to generate larger amounts of data allows researchers to target their recruitment efforts more efficiently. This can reduce time, cost, and server resource constraints while maximizing the quantity of collected data. If researchers can recruit players who are likely to contribute more gameplay data, they may not need as many participants overall. This can still give them enough information to answer their scientific questions while preserving the size of the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will examine how demographics (such as age and gender) as well as gameplay experience variables can be used to classify which players are likely to generate above-average gameplay time, and therefore, more gameplay data for the researchers examining the Minecraft server. \n"

    "### The Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The broad research question provided by the research team is the following:  \n",
    "*\"Which kinds of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "The specifc research question I will be answering is: \n",
    "*\"Can age, gender, and experience level predict whether a player is a high-playtime player (someone who plays more than the average number of hours) in the players,csv Minecraft research server dataset?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on this question, I aim to explore how player characteristics may be related to the amount of gameplay data each person contributes. Since the research team is collecting in-game action logs, players who spend more time on the server naturally generate more gameplay data for researchers. So, it would be beneficial for researchers to seek out high-playtime participants, who will spend more time on the server, and thus, generate more data for them. In this project, I will use the existing data  in the `players.csv` dataset to train a classification model. This model will allow us to predict, based on a new player's characteristics, whether they are likely to become a high-playtime player, and thus, a high-data generating player. In doing so, the research team could use these predictions to guide future recruitment. \n"
